The dygraphs JS binary has ballooned by about 3x over the past three years.

Things to do to make dygraph-combine.js smaller:
- (1431) Remove srtftime, which is only minimally used.
- (4191) Move range selector out of core
- (2645) Simplify or eliminate dygraph-interaction-model.js.
- (1983) Remove stacktrace.js from dygraph-combined.js
- (????) Switch to Closure Compiler, which is more aggressive about dead code removal.
- (????) Unify Dygraph.prototype.log vs. Dygraph.log
- (????) Combined findPos{X,Y}, page{X,Y}
- (????) merge update, updateDeep, clone
- (????) can we kill the iterator stuff?
- (????) move kberg's polygon stuff into a plugin
- (????) unify/simplify date processing code (dateString_, hmsString_, ...)

To measure size:
$ ./generate-combined.sh cat_minified | wc -c

To test correctness:
$ make test-combined
