The dygraphs JS binary has ballooned by about 3x over the past three years.

Things to do to make dygraph-combine.js smaller:
- (1431) Remove srtftime, which is only minimally used.
- (4191) Move range selector out of core
- (2645) Simplify or eliminate dygraph-interaction-model.js.
- (1983) Remove stacktrace.js from dygraph-combined.js
- (????) Switch to Closure Compiler, which is more aggressive about dead code removal.
